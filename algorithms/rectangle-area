Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as
shown in the figure.

Example:

    
    
    Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
    Output: 45

Note:

Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.

Exp Starter Code:
class Solution {public:int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {}};​
