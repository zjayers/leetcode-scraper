Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the
same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree
consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could
also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Example 1:  
Given tree s:

    
    
         3
        / \
       4   5
      / \
     1   2
    

Given tree t:

    
    
       4 
      / \
     1   2
    

Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree
of s.



Example 2:  
Given tree s:

    
    
         3
        / \
       4   5
      / \
     1   2
        /
       0
    

Given tree t:

    
    
       4
      / \
     1   2
    

Return false.
