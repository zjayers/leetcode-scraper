Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree.

Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate
children.

Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the
tree.



Example 1:

    Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
    

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst_cameras_02.png)

    
    
    Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
    

  
Note:

  1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
  2. Every node has value 0.
