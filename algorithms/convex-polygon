Given a list of points that form a polygon when joined sequentially, find if
this polygon is convex [(Convex polygon
definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon).



Note:

  1. There are at least 3 and at most 10,000 points.
  2. Coordinates are in the range -10,000 to 10,000.
  3. You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon[ (Simple polygon definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_polygon). In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex, and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.



Example 1:

    
    
    [[0,0],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0]]
    
    Answer: True

Example 2:

    
    
    [[0,0],[0,10],[10,10],[10,0],[5,5]]
    
    Answer: False
