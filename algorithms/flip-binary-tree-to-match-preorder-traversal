Given a binary tree with `N` nodes, each node has a different value from `{1,
..., N}`.

A node in this binary tree can be flipped by swapping the left child and the
right child of that node.

Consider the sequence of `N` values reported by a preorder traversal starting
from the root.  Call such a sequence of `N` values the voyage of the tree.

(Recall that a preorder traversal of a node means we report the current node's
value, then preorder-traverse the left child, then preorder-traverse the right
child.)

Our goal is to flip the least number of nodes in the tree so that the voyage
of the tree matches the `voyage` we are given.

If we can do so, then return a list of the values of all nodes flipped.  You
may return the answer in any order.

If we cannot do so, then return the list `[-1]`.



Example 1:

    Input: root = [1,2], voyage = [2,1]
    Output: [-1]
    

Example 2:

    Input: root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,3,2]
    Output: [1]
    

Example 3:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/02/1219-02.png)

    
    
    Input: root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,2,3]
    Output: []
