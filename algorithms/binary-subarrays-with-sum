In an array `A` of `0`s and `1`s, how many non-empty subarrays have sum `S`?



Example 1:

    
    
    Input: A = [1,0,1,0,1], S = 2
    Output: 4
    Explanation: 
    The 4 subarrays are bolded below:
    [1,0,1,0,1]
    [1,0,1,0,1]
    [1,0,1,0,1]
    [1,0,1,0,1]
    



Note:

  1. `A.length <= 30000`
  2. `0 <= S <= A.length`
  3. `A[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

Exp Starter Code:
class Solution {public:int numSubarraysWithSum(vector<int>& A, int S) {}};​
