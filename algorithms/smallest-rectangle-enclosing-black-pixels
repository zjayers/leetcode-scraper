An image is represented by a binary matrix with `0` as a white pixel and `1`
as a black pixel. The black pixels are connected, i.e., there is only one
black region. Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically. Given the
location `(x, y)` of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest
(axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.

Example:

    
    
    Input:
    [
      "0010",
      "0110",
      "0100"
    ]
    and x = 0, y = 2
    
    Output: 6
    

Exp Starter Code:
class Solution {public:int minArea(vector<vector<char>>& image, int x, int y) {}};​
