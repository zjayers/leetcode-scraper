Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and
implements a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and return the
shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be
called repeatedly many times with different parameters.

Example:  
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

    
    
    Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
    Output: 3
    
    
    
    Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
    Output: 1

Note:  
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are
both in the list.

Exp Starter Code:
class WordDistance {public:WordDistance(vector<string>& words) {}int shortest(string word1, string word2) {}};​/*** Your WordDistance object will be instantiated and called as such:* WordDistance* obj = new WordDistance(words);* int param_1 = obj->shortest(word1,word2);*/​
