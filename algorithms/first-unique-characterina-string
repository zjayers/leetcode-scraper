Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its
index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:

    
    
    s = "leetcode"
    return 0.
    
    s = "loveleetcode"
    return 2.
    



Note: You may assume the string contains only lowercase English letters.

Exp Starter Code:
class Solution {public:int firstUniqChar(string s) {}};​
